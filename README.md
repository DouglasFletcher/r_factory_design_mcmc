# Reference Classes in R - bugs vs. linear modelling package
The purpose of this repository is to firstly explore Reference classes in R - mostly seeing how easy / hard it is to implement 
a factory design pattern. The theme is building a wrapper for bugs MCMC vs. linear modelling. Essentially this could be extended to 
other modelling classes, assuming they are able to match the abstract class specifications.
